useState: add some thing to the state and rendering to functional component

in useState hooks we can use multiple data types like number, boolean, string, undefined, null, array, obj etc

use State function return an array with 2 element (current value of state, state setter function )

New state value depends on the previous state value? you can pass a function to the setter function 

When dealing with objects and arrays, always make sure to spread your state variable and then call the setter function
