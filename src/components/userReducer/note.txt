useReducer: It is a hook that is used for state management. It is an alternative to useState.

What is the difference:
useState is build using useReducer

Hooks so far:
useState ==> state
useEffect ==> side effects
useContext ==> context API
useReducer ==> Reducers

reduce VS useReducer

reduce in JS: 
1) array.reduce(callback fun, initial value)
2) singleValue = reducer(acc, itemValue)
3) It return a single value

reduce in React: 
1) useReducer(callback fun, initial state)
2) newState = reducer(currentState, action)
3) It return a pair of values. [newState, dispatch]
