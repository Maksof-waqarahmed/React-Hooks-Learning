What is Hooks: Hooks are a new feature addition in react v 16.8 which allow you to use react features without having to write a class. Hooks don't work inside classes

Roles of Hooks: 
1) Only call hooks at the top level
Don't call hooks inside loops, condition, or nested functions

2) only call hooks from react functions
Call them from within react functional components and not just any regular JS functions
